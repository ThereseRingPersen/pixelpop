**_Twirl, Tweak, and Transform: Bring Joy to Your UI Themes 🎡✨🧩_**

PixelPop is a playful React project that brings two distinct themes to life using Joy UI: a bright and bubbly Barbie-inspired style and a bold, retro 90’s look. It’s all about experimenting with colors, shapes, and styles to see just how far you can take component theming.

## 🍭What’s in the Box

- **Barbie Theme 🌸💅🛼:** Dive into a world of vibrant pinks, playful fonts, and soft edges. It’s a theme that doesn’t take itself too seriously.
- **90’s Theme 📼🕹️:** Square corners, bold hues, and a dash of nostalgia. Think early web aesthetics with a modern twist.
- **Light and Dark Modes 🌞🌙:** Both themes adapt beautifully to light and dark settings, adding even more variety to the mix.
- **Vite-Powered ⚡🚀**: Built with Vite for a snappy development experience that lets you see changes instantly.
- **React Router 🧭📍🗺️**: Easily hop between themes and explore the different looks without missing a beat.

## 🍭Why PixelPop?

PixelPop was born from a desire to experiment with Joy UI and push the boundaries of theming. 🎨✨ I created this project as a playground 🛝 to explore vibrant, nostalgic styles—from 90’s retro vibes 🕹️📼 to playful pink aesthetics 🎀🦄—and to see just how far I could take custom component styling. It’s all about having fun 🤹‍♂️ with design and discovering new creative possibilities! 🚀🌈

Pop in, explore the themes, and maybe get inspired along the way. 🎉
